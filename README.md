# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at predicting real estate property prices using machine learning techniques. It involves the development of a predictive model that takes property features into account, such as size, location, and other attributes, to estimate the market value of properties. The project also includes outlier detection and feature engineering to enhance the model's performance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the predictive model.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts and utilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realestate-prediction.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for insights into data analysis, preprocessing, and model development.
4. Customize the model and scripts as needed for your real estate data.

## Data

The data used for this project can be found in the `data/` directory. It includes datasets with real estate property information, historical sales data, and relevant features.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data to make it suitable for modeling. This step is implemented in the `src/data_preprocessing.py` script.

## Model Development

The model is developed in the `src/model.py` script. It utilizes a combination of linear regression for classification, outlier detection, and feature engineering to classify property prices.

## Model Evaluation

To assess the model's performance, various evaluation metrics are used, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The `notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook provides detailed evaluation results.

## Usage

- To use the predictive model, refer to the `src/predict.py` script.
- To train or retrain the model, modify the code in the `src/model.py` script and run it.
